# To-Do-List
To-Do list can improve your work and personal life. You can use it to reduce the stress in your life and get more done in less time. It also helps you become more reliable for other people and save time for the best things in life.
This To-Do-List was created using Python and SQLAlchemy. SQL is used to store the user's tasks and allows for different queries on the database. These queries include inserting a new task, deleting a stored task, or looking at tasks that may have passed the deadline.
